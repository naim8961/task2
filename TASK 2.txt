To conduct data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, let’s break down the process into distinct steps. We’ll outline the general approach, describe key analyses, and identify patterns or trends in the dataset. Although I can’t access the dataset directly, I’ll guide you through the process.

Step 1: Loading the Data

Start by importing the necessary libraries and loading the Titanic dataset.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset (assuming you've downloaded it)
train_data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')

Step 2: Data Cleaning

2.1. Check for Missing Values

First, check for missing values in the dataset.

train_data.isnull().sum()

Missing Values:
	•	Common columns that may have missing values include Age, Embarked, and Cabin.

We can handle these missing values in the following ways:
	•	Age: Impute with the median value or use more complex methods such as prediction models.
	•	Embarked: Impute with the most frequent value.
	•	Cabin: This has many missing values, so we could drop this column or try to extract meaningful information (e.g., deck levels).

# Impute missing 'Age' with median
train_data['Age'] = train_data['Age'].fillna(train_data['Age'].median())

# Impute missing 'Embarked' with the mode (most frequent value)
train_data['Embarked'] = train_data['Embarked'].fillna(train_data['Embarked'].mode()[0])

# Drop 'Cabin' column (or we can extract 'Deck' if needed)
train_data.drop(columns=['Cabin'], inplace=True)

2.2. Handle Categorical Variables

Some categorical variables, like Sex and Embarked, need to be encoded for analysis:

# Convert 'Sex' to numerical (0 for female, 1 for male)
train_data['Sex'] = train_data['Sex'].map({'female': 0, 'male': 1})

# Convert 'Embarked' to numerical using one-hot encoding
train_data = pd.get_dummies(train_data, columns=['Embarked'], drop_first=True)

2.3. Remove Irrelevant Columns

Columns like Name, Ticket, and PassengerId may not contribute directly to predictive analysis, so we can drop them.

train_data.drop(columns=['Name', 'Ticket', 'PassengerId'], inplace=True)

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3.1. Summary Statistics

Get a high-level overview of the data with descriptive statistics.

train_data.describe()

This will give you an idea of the distribution of numerical columns, such as Age, Fare, etc.

3.2. Visualizing the Distribution of Key Variables

Plot histograms for continuous variables (Age, Fare).

# Distribution of Age
sns.histplot(train_data['Age'], kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Age')
plt.show()

# Distribution of Fare
sns.histplot(train_data['Fare'], kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Fare')
plt.show()

3.3. Visualizing the Target Variable (Survived)

Visualize the survival rate.

sns.countplot(x='Survived', data=train_data)
plt.title('Survival Count')
plt.show()

3.4. Relationship Between Variables

Explore relationships between various features and survival:

3.4.1. Survival vs. Gender

sns.countplot(x='Survived', hue='Sex', data=train_data)
plt.title('Survival by Gender')
plt.show()

This plot will show if gender has any impact on survival.

3.4.2. Survival vs. Class

sns.countplot(x='Survived', hue='Pclass', data=train_data)
plt.title('Survival by Passenger Class')
plt.show()

This will help assess if passengers from higher classes had higher survival rates.

3.4.3. Survival vs. Age

sns.kdeplot(data=train_data, x='Age', hue='Survived', common_norm=False)
plt.title('Survival by Age')
plt.show()

This can help you understand the impact of age on survival rates.

3.4.4. Survival vs. Embarked

sns.countplot(x='Survived', hue='Embarked_C', data=train_data)
plt.title('Survival by Embarked (C)')
plt.show()

Check the relationship between embarkation point and survival.

3.5. Correlation Matrix

Plot a heatmap to check the correlation between numerical variables.

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.heatmap(train_data.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt='.2f')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()

3.6. Pairplot

A pairplot can give insights into relationships between multiple variables.

sns.pairplot(train_data, hue='Survived')
plt.show()

Step 4: Identify Patterns and Trends

Based on the EDA, here are some typical insights that can emerge:
	1.	Gender: Women had a higher chance of survival compared to men.
	2.	Class: Passengers in 1st class had a higher survival rate than those in 2nd and 3rd classes.
	3.	Age: Younger passengers (children) had a higher survival rate, likely due to prioritization in lifeboats.
	4.	Embarked: Passengers who boarded from Cherbourg (C) had a higher survival rate.
	5.	Fare: Higher fares are often correlated with higher social class, and those in higher classes survived at higher rates.

Step 5: Feature Engineering (Optional)

You could generate additional features based on the data, such as:
	•	Family Size: Combine SibSp and Parch to create a new feature indicating family size.

train_data['FamilySize'] = train_data['SibSp'] + train_data['Parch']

	•	IsAlone: A binary feature indicating whether the passenger is alone.

train_data['IsAlone'] = (train_data['FamilySize'] == 0).astype(int)

Step 6: Conclusion and Next Steps

From the initial EDA, you will have a better understanding of key patterns in the data. For predictive modeling, you can:
	•	Scale numerical features (e.g., Age, Fare).
	•	Train models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or even XGBoost.
	•	Evaluate performance using cross-validation and metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

This process will provide a thorough exploration of the Titanic dataset, allowing you to derive meaningful insights and develop a predictive model.
